#' Compare a char string and char vector
#'
#' Takes a char vector and char string as input, compares the string to every
#' element of the char vector, output is a logical vector with length equal to
#' the input char vector. This is replacing the R code "vector == string".
#'
#' @param lookupvect Character vector.
#' @param charstring Character string.

#' Find the string that's most freqent in a vector.
#'
#' Given a cluster suitable for merging, find all instances within vect_sub
#' that coorspond with that cluster and get the most freqently occuring
#' value (this is basically using freq to choose the value from the original
#' data that will be used as the template for all elements of a single cluster).
#' eg, if we have a cluster value that correspond with these values from the
#' original data: c("Bob's Pizza", "bobs pizza", "Bob's Pizza"), then all those
#' values would be edited to be "Bob's Pizza", since its the most frequent.
