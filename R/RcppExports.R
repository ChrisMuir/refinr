#' Compare a char string and char vector
#'
#' Takes a char vector and char string as input, compares the string to every
#' element of the char vector, output is a logical vector with length equal to
#' the input char vector. This is replacing the R code "vector == string".
#'
#' @param lookupvect Character vector.
#' @param charstring Character string.
equality <- function(lookupvect, charstring) {
    .Call('refinr_equality', PACKAGE = 'refinr', lookupvect, charstring)
}

#' Merge clusters of similar values.
#'
#' Function that performs all merges related to input value clusters.
#' @param clusters character vector
#' @param keys character vector
#' @param vect character vector
#' @param keyssub character vector
#' @param vectsub character vector
merge_clusters <- function(clusters, keys, vect, keyssub, vectsub) {
    .Call('refinr_merge_clusters', PACKAGE = 'refinr', clusters, keys, vect, keyssub, vectsub)
}

#' Find the string that's most freqent in a vector.
#'
#' Given a cluster suitable for merging, find all instances within vectsub
#' that coorspond with that cluster and get the most freqently occuring
#' value (this is basically using freq to choose the value from the original
#' data that will be used as the template for all elements of a single cluster).
#' eg, if we have a cluster value that coorespond with these values from the
#' original data: c("Bob's Pizza", "bobs pizza", "Bob's Pizza"), then all those
#' values would be edited to be "Bob's Pizza", since its the most frequent.
#'
#' @param clust character string
#' @param keyssub character vector
#' @param vectsub character vector
