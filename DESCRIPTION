Title: Functions for Merging Similar Values within a Character Vector
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Chris", "Muir", email = "chrismuirRVA@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: These functions take a character vector as input, identify and 
  cluster similar values, and then merge clusters together so their values 
  become identical. The functions in this package are an implementation of the 
  key collision and ngram fingerprint algorithms from the OSS tool OpenRefine. 
  More info on OpenRefine can be found here http://openrefine.org/. More info 
  on key collision and ngram fingerprint can be found here
