Title: Cluster and Merge Similar Values Within a Character Vector
Version: 0.2.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Chris", "Muir", email = "chrismuirRVA@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: These functions take a character vector as input, identify and cluster similar values, and then merge clusters together so their values become identical. The functions are an implementation of the key collision and ngram fingerprint algorithms from the open source tool Open Refine <http://openrefine.org/>. More info on key collision and ngram fingerprint can be found here <https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering-In-Depth>.
